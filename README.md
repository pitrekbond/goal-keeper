### Usage
To be able to use the project, you need to register (if you haven't already) with your name, email and password. You'll then receive an email to confirm your 
signup. 
The app's main functionality is task management - to create a new task you need to click the "+ New Task" button located at the top of the page and fill in the form.
You can manage all your tasks in the "My tasks" tab. A table of tasks will be displayed, which you can filter by different criteria. You can also edit a task there and delete it. Apart from the tasks, you can manage notes in a similar way in the "Notes" tab. 
The dashboard shows some general data including the incoming tasks, latest notes, a calendar component in which you can click a date to display tasks with deadline on this exact day and also a bunch of statistics regarding your tasks.
In settings tab (accessed by clicking the person icon) the user can modify their account data, including changing their profile picture displayed in the application.
Lastly, the user can also toggle the dark mode by clicking the moon icon.

#### Technologies Used
The project was created in pure React, using Tailwind CSS for styling.
